When the SG1 and SG2 teams are ordered to infiltrate and investigate the forests of Northern Washington, things don't go as planned as the entirety of SG1 is captured. How will FRED get them out of this mess? Will Sha're land the gig after her backroom casting couch audition?? The Go'auld really really like kids, it's really weird man. It's a full frontal, action packed episode of SG1! #LongLiveCavemanGuy
